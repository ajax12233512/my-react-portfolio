# React Portfolio

*SOURCE CODE IS LOCATED IN THE `code` branch of this repository*

This one-page application consists of my latest programming status and projects. I created this website with react.js and p5.js. It was a pleasure to experiment
with creative front-end designs using a very easy-to-use graphics framework such as p5. Also, with the powerful use of components and state in react, it was very efficient 
to create a layout that was well suited for the portfolio. 

# Objective 

To present my skills to potential employers in the software engineering field.

# Technologies Used
1. React
2. P5

# Obstacles

State is a very complicated topic for me. However, as time goes by I'm slowing starting to understand how it works.
