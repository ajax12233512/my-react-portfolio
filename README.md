# Welcome to My Portfolio
This Portfolio was made with React.js and React-p5. It 
was a pleasure to combine both my favorite technologies
to create a portfolio that I believe highlights my skills and favorite
programming niche quite nicely. 

# Challenges
The main challenge I faced was getting used to working with the
p5 canvase inside a single react component. I had to create classes within the 
`Background` component to mediate the change in the locations of every bubble. 

# Inspiration
I am very fond of creative programming. Technologies that javascript offers such as p5.js and Three.js are some of my favorite technologies
to work with. They offer the ability to express many different ways your applications and I just love it.
